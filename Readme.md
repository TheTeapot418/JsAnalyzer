#Js Analyzer

This project is a simple frequency analyzer built with the Ge User Media and Web Audio APIs. Works best in chrome.
Due to security restrictions, Web Audio API will not work when the file is loaded locally (URL begins with file://). You must access to the page with an HTTP request. Use Wamp, Lamp, or any other web server you are familiar with.
